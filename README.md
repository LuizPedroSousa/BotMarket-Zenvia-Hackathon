## How it works🏳‍🌈

The system was designed so that users can use whatsapp as a purchase system, thus, a user would send a whatsapp message, from the moment the user sends the message, it will be registered in our system.

Once registered, the user will be able to create a shopping cart, so that he can add products to the cart. This part of the system works through an interaction of the Zenvia api, with our api. However, for employees to be able to create products and more, a mobile app was made to which only employees would have access.
